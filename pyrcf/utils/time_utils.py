    This rate limniter is meant to be used in e.g. a loop or callback function.
    It is, in essence, the same as rospy.Rate_. It assumes Python's performance
    counter never jumps backward nor forward, so that it does not handle such
    cases contrary to rospy.Rate_.

        warn: If set (default), warn when the time between two calls
            exceeded the rate clock.
